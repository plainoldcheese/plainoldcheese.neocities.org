				i actually don't mind that the pages of this site have nothing in common, but i look at
				some of the
				beautifully curated aesthetics of some other neocitizens sites and get a bit
				jealous. but i guess that's just who i am in general. i crave novelty and need
				things to feel fresh and new. so i like starting a new page from scratch.

				4 stage interviews and reports that i have to submit for the interviews and tests i have
				to do for the

			<h3>This sparks joy âœ¨</h3>
			<time>22-10-2023</time>
			<p>getting back into updating this site has made me really happy, I've been thinking about how I
				spend my time
				on the internet. I've gone both ways in the past. Absolute off-grid no social media
				whatsoever, and I've tried
				to cultivate a presence on the different platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit,
				etc. Now I think I'm just
				going to decide what I actually like.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Little bit of a rant</summary>
				Privacy concerns aside I still like Reddit, it feels like it really
				connects people around interests and it's quite as self centred. Instagram and Facebook
				have just become so
				boring and homogenised it doesn't even show you what you follow, just what it thinks you
				want to see. I don't
				feel like there's any personal connection there anymore. Mastodon has been okay but
				finding people I want to
				follow is difficult. I haven't been on Twitter in years and I'm not sure I want to make
				any new social accounts
				I enjoy Discord for a similar reason to Reddit only it feels more personal. I like being
				able to chat to people
				about a common interest and discord is great for that. Then lastly there's Neocities. I
				haven't had the pleasure
				of any direct contact with any Neocitizens, but I like the vibe, and I'd love to setup a
				guestbook or something.
				I think what I really miss is that sense of connection social media used to provide. It
				used to be about
				reconnecting with old friends or keeping up to date with what your friends were up to
				when you weren't together.
				Now it's very commercialised, there's no sense of time because nothing is chronological
				and I feel like there's
				constantly some kind of message being pushed on me. Like the powers at be are trying to
				manipulate the
				population. YouTube isn't really social media, but I've decided I'm gonna cut YouTube
				shorts out. They really
				make me upset and I can end up doom-scrolling through stuff that I don't like for hours.
				Short form video feels
				really dystopian at times. But anyway, that's my take on it and I hope I can be more
				mindful and curate my
				online experience in a way that brings me joy and adds to my life.

I think what I really miss is that sense of connection social media used to provide. It
used to be about
reconnecting with old friends or keeping up to date with what your friends were up to
when you weren't together.
Now it's very commercialised, there's no sense of time because nothing is chronological
and I feel like there's
constantly some kind of message being pushed on me. Like the powers at be are trying to
manipulate the
population. YouTube isn't really social media, but I've decided I'm gonna cut YouTube
shorts out. They really
make me upset and I can end up doom-scrolling through stuff that I don't like for hours.
Short form video feels
really dystopian at times. But anyway, that's my take on it and I hope I can be more
mindful and curate my
online experience in a way that brings me joy and adds to my life.

</html>t to see. I don't
feel like there's any personal connection there anymore. Mastodon has been okay but
finding people I want to
follow is difficult. I haven't been on Twitter in years and I'm not sure I want to make
any new social accounts
I enjoy Discord for a similar reason to Reddit only it feels more personal. I like being
able to chat to people
about a common interest and discord is great for that. Then lastly there's Neocities. I
haven't had the pleasure
of any direct contact with any Neocitizens, but I like the vibe, and I'd love to setup a
guestbook or something.
I think what I really miss is that sense of connection social media used to provide. It
used to be about
reconnecting with old friends or keeping up to date with what your friends were up to
when you weren't together.
Now it's very commercialised, there's no sense of time because nothing is chronological
