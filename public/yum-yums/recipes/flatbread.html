      <h1>Soft Mediterranean Flatbread</h1>
      <p>
        Quick and easy flatbread recipe. Ideal for dipping into hummus or
        tzatziki, or just as a side.
      </p>
      <p>makes 8 medium sized flatbreads</p>
      <ul>
        <li>prep time: 15min</li>
        <li>wait time: 20min</li>
        <li>cook time: 30 sec each</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 packet (9 g) instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>fresh chopped garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil (optional)</li>
        <li>fresh coriander leaves (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mix together the water, salt, sugar and instant yeast till frothy (I
          like to use a tiny whisk).
        </li>
        <li>Add the flour to a bowl.</li>
        <li>
          Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to combine with
          hands or a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the mixture has been combined, knead for 5 minutes or until it
          forms a smooth ball that springs back a little bit when pressed. If
          the dough is too dry add a tablespoon of warm water at a time while
          kneading, if it's too wet add a tbsp of flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise for 20
          minutes, or until doubled in size
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the dough into 8 pieces, and roll into individual balls. Let rest
          for around 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a flour dusted surface, roll out the balls into flatbreads. If they
          keep springing back while rolling, let them rest a little longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook on a fire/gas grill (braai ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦) or pan (non-stick or cast iron
          recommended) for 30-45 seconds each side. You can flip once you start
          seeing bubbles and the top surface appear to be mostly cooked. The
          second side usually goes a bit quicker.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, Brush the flatbreads with extra virgin olive oil, and
          sprinkle with chopped garlic and coriander leaves.
        </li>
      </ol>
